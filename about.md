I am [a software
developer](https://github.com/jonathan-scholbach){:target="_blank"}. I use
writing for learning and understanding. It helps me explore ideas and
clarify concepts. Don't expect more from this blog. Some ideas here might be
original, but most will just be a reformulation of what has been expressed by
others in other places (and probably in better terms). Striving to publish only
original ideas would stop me from writing anything, because it is very hard for
me to assess if an idea I have is truly original.

If you find anything here worth discussing, I appreciate your <a

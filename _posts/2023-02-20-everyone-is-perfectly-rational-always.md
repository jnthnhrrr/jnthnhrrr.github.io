When we are in conflict with others, we sometimes start to believe they are
_irrational_.

This article makes the case why we should always assume that our counterpart in
a collaborative relation is acting in a perfectly rational manner. The argument
has two parts: First, starting from a definition of rationality, we will see
that we can never actually know whether our counterpart is rational. Second, as
the argument goes, we should always assume that our counterpart is perfectly
rational for pragmatic reasons in our own self-interest.

The article is a reflection on psychological phenomena occurring in discussions
and conflict. It unfolds a model of human beings and interactions which aims at
improving collaboration.


# 1. We Can Never Know

Let's start with a definition of rationality. [Stanford Encycopledia of
Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-instrumental/) has a
good definition:

> Someone displays instrumental rationality insofar as she adopts suitable means
> to her ends.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality) has a similar one:

> In its most common sense, rationality is the quality of being guided by
> reasons or being reasonable. For example, a person who acts rationally has
> good reasons for what they do. This usually implies that they reflected on the
> possible consequences of their action and the goal it is supposed to realize.

The point of these definitions is: rationality is _instrumental_. Rationality
means to apply the best means _to achieve a certain goal_. A certain behavior
cannot be judged as _absolutely_ rational (or irrational), but this question is
_relative_. Rationality is not an attribute of actions, but _a quality of the
relation between actions and goals_.

While we can directly observe the behavior of someone, we have no direct access
to their preferences. If we are not aware of the fact that the preferences of
them are not accessible to us, we tend to assume the goals of the person are
similar to our own goals. Lacking actual information, we insert an assumption.
This assumption seems to be so natural that we often don't even notice it, and
we are not aware that this is but a hypothesis. Forgetting this can lead to
flawed results -- Whenever a person has preferences differing a lot from our own
we might attribute irrationality to them when in fact we just fail to understand
the difference in preferences.

Whenever we conclude that someone is irrational, because they act in a way we do
not understand, this conclusion is a _fallacy_.[^nb] The behavior of a person
does not give us access to their preferences. Since the rationality of a
certain behavior depends on these unknown preferences, we cannot tell whether a
person is acting rationally from their behavior alone.

[^nb]:
    Saying that it is _a fallacy_ to conclude that a person is irrational does
    not mean that the person is rational. It may or may not be true that the
    person is irrational. Here, the argument merely states that we cannot know,
    based on the behavior of the person alone.

Asking "Is this behavior rational?" without knowing the preferences is similar
to asking "Is a hammer a good tool?" without knowing what we want to achieve.
Whether the hammer is a good tool, certainly depends on the goal we want to
achieve with it. When we need to get a nail into a wall, a hammer may be a good
instrument. When we want to cure our headache, or clean our windows, we better
look for something else.

The above does not only apply to what a person is doing, but also to what
someone is uttering about themselves and their preferences. If someone says
they prefer strawberry ice cream, although they always order raspberry ice
cream, they might be just irrational. Or they might have a motive to say (or
even _to believe_) that strawberry is their favorite, while it is actually
raspberry. Psychologists, economists and UX-designers can tell: people are not
always aware of their motives. Them telling us about their preferences is not a
direct access to their actual preferences either. Even if they claim
some preferences and act against them, we still cannot be sure whether they are
behaving irrationally or whether they are unaware of their preferences (or not
telling the truth about them).

The hypothesis that someone is rational or irrational can actually not be
tested. In that regard, it is like the hypothesis that the universe just got
created a second ago (including all the video records of our past birthdays and
the photos in our smartphone of our last trip to Paris, and also including our
own state of mind, including all our memories). There is no argument _per se_
against this hypothesis. But it is a remarkable feature of that theory that it
is self-immunizing against empirical falsification.

Notice that this does not mean that it was _false_ to assume someone's
irrationality -- it may or may not be true. We just can never know.


# 2. We Should Always Assume the Other One is Perfectly Rational

The whole point of this rather philosophical encounter is to demonstrate that we
have _a choice_ in believing whether someone is rational or not. That choice is
not bound by our observations. As any observation cannot prove or disprove
someone's rationality, our choice is independent from that.

That being established, the second step of the argument contains a pragmatic
appeal to why, in general, we should choose to believe that someone is
rational.

That first step above is quite a shift in the understanding of the claim that
someone is irrational. The following second part of the argument -- that we
should always assume someone is rational -- is fully based on that shift of
perspective. We are not longer talking about whether someone is rational or not
(because we have seen above that it does not make sense to ask this question, as
we cannot answer it). Instead, we take a step back and have a look at what the
better assumption is.

When we are confronted with a person whose actions we do not understand (in
descriptive terms) and do not accept (in normative terms), we have a tendency to
perceive them as irrational. It makes sense to take a short break and ask why we do
so. We might do so because we feel threatened: If their opinion is different,
it might be the case we are wrong. Labelling the other person as irrational can
be understood as an immunization strategy, which helps us avoid the painful
question whether it is them or actually it is us who is wrong. The latter
outcome would be irritating and involve a big mental effort. So it makes sense,
that we try to avoid the question in the first place.

It is psychologically understandable why we do this. And sometimes it may
actually be a good strategy: For instance, if we do not want to collaborate with
someone, it is easier to not invest so many resources into establishing complex
explanations for their behavior.

However, this article is based on the premise that we want to improve our
collaboration. Hence, let's focus on an argument why, under that premise, we
should always assume the other person is perfectly rational.

For that, it makes sense to shift focus and look at what happens to ourselves
whenever we claim someone to be irrational: As soon as we assume that someone is
"just" irrational, we stop making attempts to understand them. We basically say:
There is no consistent way to describe the decision making of this person. Our
explanation puts a big question mark at the center of the other person's
decisions. And then, that's the end of it.[^grammar-book] That way,
we will never be able to understand the person.

[^grammar-book]:
    It is a little like consulting a slightly old-fashioned grammar book when
    trying to understand how the youth speaks. Taking the book as an
    authoritative source of _right_ and _wrong_, all we can say is that
    they are speaking _in a wrong way_ (according to the book). But that makes
    us fail to understand _how_ they speak. If we are interested in
    understanding the grammar of the new language, we need to step away from the
    normative assumption that people have to be the way we expect them to be. In
    that analogy, the grammar book corresponds to our own preferences, and the
    deviant grammar of the youth corresponds to the hidden rationality of the
    other person.

From this perspective, assuming that the other person is irrational is actually
not so much a statement about them, but rather a statement about our willingness
to create a more complex model of their preferences. It means as much as the
economic statement: "It is not worth the effort investigating how the decision
making process of this person works.[^coherence]

[^coherence]:
    The same argument applies to approaches trying to define rationality in
    terms of _global coherence_ of the actions of a person. The famous example is
    a person with an overall preference for health. When they smoke, the theory
    of coherence goes, they are acting irrationally because they are not acting
    in a globally coherent way. But this is actually just a problem in
    _describing_ the person's preferences, not a problem with the person's
    preferences themselves. The premise of globally coherent preferences is
    undercomplex and fails at accurately describing the actual preferences of
    the person: They might want to be healthy, but they also crave a cigarette
    right now. That is a more complex model than saying "They want to be
    healthy, and smoking a cigarette right now is irrational." It also gives
    raise to questions like "Why do they want to smoke a cigarette right now?",
    opening paths to changing that decision making. Instead of imposing an
    overly simplified model on the smoking person, a more complex model of
    "mixed preferences", "stratified preferences" or "context-sensitive
    preferences" provides a better understanding of the person's decision making
    (when we say that a certain model is a "better understanding of a system",
    if it provides more options to change that system).

If instead, we assume that the other person is rational, we have to search for a
difference in their preferences and motives in order to explain their
behavior. That way, we will still maintain some testable model of their mind.
From the perspective of an empirical researcher, we _have to_ assume the
person is rational, as doing otherwise would simply break the empirical paradigm
-- it would be like saying: "Thunder and lightning are magical forces which we
must not seek to explain". Sure, it is possible to see the world that way. But
we pay a very big price in terms of lack of understanding the world around us
for the psychological feeling of safety that we gain with this attitude.

In work contexts, there is often a gain in collaboration. It is always our
choice whether we want to put extra effort into improving collaboration with
people we have problems with. The article just provides a mindset which helps
broaden the repertoire of possible behaviors. We can still choose to consider
others as irrational. But in case we do see value in working better with them,
we now have a strategy how to resolve this unproductive hypothesis that blocks
the relation with that person from growing into better understanding, deeper
trust and more productive collaboration.
